The year is 2183 and the USA is at war with Russia!

After returning from a top-secret mission, a small group of spies has located the location of Russia’s secret base. The Commander-In-Chief has ordered an orbital strike directly on that base. However, resources have dwindled due to the war and you don’t have the equipment to build a powerful missile.

The government has hired you, an engineer for the Department of Defence(DD), to create an alternative weapon to use during the orbital strike.

You, and your ingenious brain, propose an idea: instead of building a missile, you just apply basic physics. Force is equal to mass times acceleration, so why not just drop a really heavy object from space! Luckily, the DD happens to have a massive inventory of osmium, the densest chemical element.

YOUR OBJECTIVE:
You will design a cylindrical rod of osmium, determine its dimensions, and decide what altitude to drop it from. From that data, we can determine how much force the osmium will produce. Once you have completed that, the Space Force will take several of your osmium rods into orbit and launch an orbital strike

If all goes well, this could end the war.
